These are test programs to do sound spectral analysis on arduino using standard fft and  fht libraries.

Analog data is picked up from ADC pin A0. The resulting spectrum is visible ASCII stylel on the Serial output. 

fft

Dependencies:
-------------
https://github.com/kosme/arduinoFFT


Compile/run:
------------

Move to the fft directory
$ cd fft

To compile type
$ make


To view the output type
$ make monitor


fht

Dependencies:
-------------
http://wiki.openmusiclabs.com/wiki/ArduinoFFT

Compile/run:
------------

Move to the fht directory
$ cd fht

To compile type
$ make


To view the output type
$ make monitor


Known bugs: 
-----------
The fht library isn't compatible with the most recent version of the arduino software. Thus it cannot run on the esp8266 (needed for a certain project). 

I generally got better results (less noisy) with the fht library, altough I suspect it requires more CPU.
